Wine fraud relates to the commercial aspects of wine. The most prevalent type of fraud is one where wines are adulterated, usually with the addition of cheaper products (e.g. juices) and sometimes with harmful chemicals and sweeteners (compensating for color or flavor).

Counterfeiting and the relabelling of inferior and cheaper wines to more expensive brands is another common type of wine fraud.
